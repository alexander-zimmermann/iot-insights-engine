"""External-severity tests — the Basalte-written faults become episodes.

Basalte detects, writes a severity 0-3 to the fault's group address and
delivers push and e-mail itself; the engine reads those writes back from
the bus archive and only records. Every test feeds invented severity
writes into the pure fold and asserts only what comes out: episodes with
their notification events, or a reconciliation plan against stored rows.
