"""Drift-measurement tests — the `drift` kind against invented series.

Every test feeds an invented series and asserts only what comes out: the
level the signal reads (a standby valley, a duty cycle), the accumulation,
observations with their scores, the current state, the published payload,
or a resolution error naming the device. The shared reconciliation is
`test_reconcile`'s; no cluster, no live database.

The load-bearing cases are the two the z-score provably could not tell
apart: a slow ramp must fire, and a small permanent step must never fire,
however long it stands. For the duty-cycle signal a third joins them: a
door left open must not read as an iced evaporator.
