"""Episode persistence: the thin edge between the pure pipeline and the
episodes tables.

Everything here is idempotent — evidence and events land with ON CONFLICT
DO NOTHING on their natural keys, and the row updates only ever raise
severity and peak and re-stamp the fingerprint, so a rerun after a
half-applied failure converges instead of duplicating.

That idempotence is also what says which episode events are *new*: `apply`
reports back the event rows the conflict clause let through, and a rerun
over the same window reports none. The runner turns exactly those into the
pointers on the bus, so an hourly recompute of a month-old episode
announces it once, on the run that first saw it.
