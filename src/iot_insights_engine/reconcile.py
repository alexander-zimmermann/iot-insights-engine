"""The shape every per-subject fault kind has: measure, fold, reconcile,
deliver.

A kind that reports per subject — a device, a room, an appliance's standby
— differs from its siblings in exactly two things: how its series is
measured (what leaves that step is a `Measured`), and how its payload is
shaped (a `SubjectPublish`). Everything between those two ends is the same
for all of them and lives here, so a new kind declares the two ends and
inherits the rest.

Reconciliation is the computed episodes against the stored open rows, and
the guarantees are the interesting part rather than the bookkeeping:

* only open computed episodes materialize as new rows; a computed episode
  that already ended matters only to close the open row it reconciles;
* a stored severity is never lowered — the recompute window may have slid
  past the peak;
* an open row whose subject produced no episode closes at the frontier,
  unless the subject is `dataless`.

`dataless` means one thing in every kind, and `measurement_reaches` is
where it is said: a subject is dataless when this run cannot tell a
recovery from a blind spot, because its measurement does not reach the
frontier. With no data to decide a recovery, its episode stays open
instead of self-clearing.

What leaves a reconciliation is `after` — the severity every subject with
an open episode carries now, the ones held open for want of data included
— and `moved`, those of them whose severity changed, including the 0 that
ends an episode. A per-subject kind turns `moved` straight into its
publishes; channel silence needs `after`, because it reports the maximum
per main group rather than per subject.
