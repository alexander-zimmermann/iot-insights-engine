"""Constancy measurement: the `constancy` kind of the fault list.

A channel keeps sending and delivers the same value hour after hour — the
producer works, the register behind it is dead. `15/1/22`, the L2 voltage
of the energy meter, read exactly 0.0 for 717 hourly buckets while its two
sibling phases carried real voltages, and looked perfectly healthy to every
measurement that only asked whether something arrived.

Kept apart from silence deliberately: the arithmetic is different (the
spread of a value against the time since the last bucket), the parameters
are different, and so is what broke. What the silence kind drops as a dead
register is exactly what this one reports.

Constancy is measured over the *extremes* of each hourly bucket, never its
average: an hour that swung and averaged back is a living register, and an
hour whose own min and max differ by more than the declared band is not
constant at all. A run ends where the value leaves the band — measured over
the whole run, so a slow walk is drift rather than constancy — and where a
bucket is missing, because an hour the channel said nothing in is silence's
business and cannot be claimed here.

Two parameters, both in the channel's own terms: `constant_hours`, how long
one value may stand, and `same_within`, what counts as the same value in
that channel's unit. Every bucket a run stands past the limit is an
observation whose score is the run length in units of that limit — the
fault's declared unit.

Like silence, time is the aggregate's own frontier, and the delivery is per
main group: the address says roughly where, the payload names the exact
channels and what each is stuck at. The per-group rule itself is shared
with silence in `groups`.
