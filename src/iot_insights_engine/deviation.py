"""Deviation measurement: the `deviation` kind of the fault list.

A value sits too far under the reference declared for it. The reference is
swappable by declaration, and what a fault declares it as decides which of
the kind's two shapes it runs in:

* **rooms against a channel** — the fault names a channel pattern for the
  reference and the optional gate, and each room names the channel it is
  measured on;
* **a daily yield against a named model** — the fault names an
  `expectation` instead, and the plant's day is compared against the kWh
  that model says it should have made.

Both compare a measured value against an expected one and score the gap in
units of the gap the fault allows; only where the two numbers come from
differs.

## Rooms against a channel

A room at least its declared gap under the setpoint while the valve is open
past the gate threshold, for at least the declared hours. The reference and
the optional gate follow a uniform naming rule across rooms, which is what
makes a pattern the honest way to write them, while each room names the
channel it is measured on. The two marry into triples — strictly both
ways, like the duration kind's device limits.

Values come from the hourly aggregate as a dense series: KNX channels are
state, not samples — a setpoint that sent once holds until changed — so
each role's last seen hourly average is carried forward across silent
buckets, deliberately without a staleness bound (a role dying mid-window
freezes the room's picture; the silence fault owns the dead channel). A
room measures only from the bucket where every role has appeared inside
the window; a room where one never does is `dataless`, must not
self-clear, and is warned about. Several value channels per room (the
sensor-less halls measure via their BWM heads) are averaged; a value
channel constant at zero for a day or more is a dead register, not a cold
room, and drops out before measurement.

Consecutive cold buckets form a run — a warm hour restarts the clock — and
every bucket from `min_hours` onward becomes an observation whose score is
the gap in units of the room's declared threshold, the fault's declared
unit. Like silence and duration, time is the aggregate's own frontier.

## A daily yield against a named model

Low PV production is nearly always the weather, so the only shortfall worth
a notification is one against what *this* weather was expected to give: the
plant's whole-day yield against the day's forecast, both in kWh. The
expectation is named in the fault entry and looked up in `EXPECTATIONS` —
the computation is handed two numbers per day and never learns which model
produced the second, so a sibling inverter or a clear-sky model is a line
in the file and a function here, and nothing else moves.

Whole days, not hours: a cloud passing at noon is not a fault, and the
counter arithmetic over a full day is exact where an hourly ratio is noise.
A day is judged only once the aggregate has moved past it — the frontier
here is the newest *complete* day, so the engine speaks about yesterday and
never about a day still in progress — and only when enough was expected of
it for a percentage to mean anything. A day that expected almost nothing
(deep overcast, or a forecast that never arrived) is unmeasured rather than
quiet, which is what keeps a dead forecast job from clearing a standing
fault. Days are UTC days: nothing is produced across a UTC midnight at this
latitude, so a local day holds the same yield and needs a timezone nobody
has to agree on.
