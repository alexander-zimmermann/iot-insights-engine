"""Episode pipeline: repeated observations of one fault fold into episodes.

Two layers, kept apart: the per-bucket evidence rows are how a course of
events is reconstructed; the episode is the unit that reports, notifications
and verdicts address. The pipeline is pure — observations in, episodes plus
notification events out — and is recomputed from history on each run, so a
redeploy cannot corrupt or lose state.

Severity is the quantile of the fault's own score distribution, promoted one
tier by duration — there is no global ladder. An episode ends after a few
quiet runs, never at the first, so a flickering fault stays one incident.
Each episode emits at most three notification events: appearing, escalating,
ending. The escalation budget spends at the first rise; later worsening
rides the severity written to the bus, never a new notification. The numeric
tiers are the delivery contract in `severity`.
