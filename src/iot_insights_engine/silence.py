"""Channel-silence measurement: the `silence` kind of the fault list.

A channel that used to send has gone silent — longer than `gap_factor`
times its own normal pause, measured from the latest bucket per channel
over the hourly aggregate. That pause is the `gap_quantile` of the
channel's own gaps rather than their median — see `normal_pause` for why
the median misreads every channel a human switches. Channel state
(alive / silent / unproven / never sent) is computed on demand from
`knx_1h`, never stored: a staleness detector working off stale data is
the joke that tells itself.

Gaps are measured against the aggregate's *frontier* (its newest bucket
anywhere), not the wall clock: the continuous aggregate materializes with
an end offset, so the newest visible bucket lags real time by an hour or
two for every channel at once. The frontier cancels that lag; a house-wide
outage is deliberately not this fault's problem (the bridge watchdog owns
it).

Channels that never sent are excluded without a report — symmetry
addresses are normal, not findings. Dead registers (a constant zero over
the whole window, like the L2 voltage that read 0.0 for 717 buckets) drop
out where the scope resolves; both drops are logged by the caller. What
silence drops here is what the constancy kind exists to report: a dead
register is not quiet, it is stuck.

A channel that first appeared inside the window is *unproven* until it
has shown as many gaps as the declared quantile needs (see `classify`):
a motion detector the coupler let through in the afternoon has only ever
shown one-hour gaps by midnight, and would read the first night of its
life as five pauses of silence. Unproven is unmeasured, not alive: no
observations, open episodes held.

Measured per channel, delivered per main group: one severity per group on
its Zentral diagnosis address, and the payload names the exact channels.
The measurement and the wire payload (`group_payload`) live here; the
per-group delivery rule is shared with constancy in `groups`, and the
runner owns the lifecycle around both.

This module also holds what every kind needs before it can measure
anything: the `Channel` a catalog query resolves to, the query itself
(`resolve_scope`), and the strict pairing of declared per-device rules to
those channels (`pair_by_match`).
