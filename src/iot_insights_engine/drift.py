"""Drift measurement: the `drift` kind of the fault list.

Something a device does sits persistently above the healthy level declared
for it. The measurement is a tabular CUSUM (Page 1954) with a **pinned**
reference: the healthy value is declared, never derived from history, so a
fault that has stood for months cannot quietly become the new normal. A
trailing reference would be worse than useless here — against a rolling
window a linear ramp scores the same whatever its slope (#1593), which is
why the z-score this replaces could never have seen a creeping standby.

Three signals walk that same CUSUM, and the fault file says which:

* **standby** — the device's idle draw in mA. A relay that no longer opens,
  not a savings topic.
* **duty_cycle** — the share of the day a compressor runs, in percent. An
  iced-up evaporator buys the same cold with far more running, months
  before anything in the freezer thaws.
* **recovery** — the heat-recovery efficiency of an air exchanger, in
  percent of the extract–outdoor gradient. The one signal that walks
  *downward*: fouling lowers what the exchanger can do, so the deficit
  below healthy accumulates instead of the excess above it.

Three steps, each its own function:

1. **The level** — the trailing window's reading of the signal. Standby is
   the *lowest* hourly floor of the trailing day (`standby_floors`): an
   appliance's hourly floor is its idle draw only in the hours it does not
   run. Duty cycle is the share of the trailing day the compressor actually
   drew above the declared on-threshold (`duty_cycles`), with door events
   cut out first. A window too thinly covered to hold a reading yields no
   sample.
2. **The accumulation** — every hour the level sits more than the declared
   rise above healthy adds its excess to a budget; an hour back inside the
   band starts the count over (`accumulate`). The rise is a floor, not a
   noise band: a permanent step smaller than it never accumulates, however
   long it stands, which is what keeps the sentence's "more than 40 mA"
   honest — the Vorratsraum dehumidifier's real +10 mA step would otherwise
   fire after a few months of standing still.
3. **The observations** — once the budget is spent, every further hour is
   an observation for the episode pipeline (`drift_observations`). The
   score is the excess in units of the declared rise, so magnitude and
   persistence stay separate: the budget decides *whether* it fires, the
   score says *how far* past the line it sits.

State is two floats and is recomputed from the aggregate on every run,
never persisted — a redeploy cannot corrupt or lose it, and replaying a
window is the same run twice. Time is the aggregate's own frontier, as
everywhere else, so a stalled materialization freezes the picture instead
of clearing episodes nobody fixed.
